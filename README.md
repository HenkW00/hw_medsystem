# HW Scripts - Med System (Rewritten)

**Description**
This is an advanced medical system that can help improve medical RP.
This script is made for NEW Update ESX 
Script got rewritten by HW Development.

**Author**
- HW Development | HenkW

**Changelog:**
- Added Config.IDmode for changing functions for radial menu.
- Added new function for retreiving correct player ID based on how the Config.IDmode is set. (either we use 'own' or 'player')
- Changed new export for retreiving/using the med system via a radial menu. (for now i just created my own, since i then can go wild on how i want it)

**Important note from the developer!**
For now the export is there, but i cant give you that much support on how to use it, if u dont use my (hw_radialmenu) on a other radial menu.
Since i focussed on working alot with OX, its easy and they just have alot of docs to learn from <3

It does use the OX Radial Menu because its easy to use, and we already work with ox_lib/ox_inventory/oxmysql/ox_target in our scripts like i mentioned.
But if you have any suggestions/ideas please join our discord, create a support ticket and let us know what you would like to see beeing implemented into the radial menu.

(yes i know, this is the med system script, but since this release is working now with the radial menu its good to inform you as reader)
